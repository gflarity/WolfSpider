This is Node.JS based manual web scraper. I've included a file that works with 500px.com. To run:

> node app.js

Then open http://localhost/drag.html, move it into a small window that you can drag onto from another browser window.

Goto http://500px.com/popular

Drag a thumbnail onto the drag window.

A folder should get created with the photographers username, the image will be inside.

More later.
